As a Data Scientist with a passion for uncovering insights and driving data-driven decisions, I hold a Data Science certificate from the International Association of Business Analytics Certification (IABAC).
I have gained hands-on experience in Python, SQL, statistical analysis, Excell and data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI.
Additionally, I completed an Artificial Intelligence course with ALX, further expanding my knowledge in AI techniques and real-world applications.

Through diverse projects, I have developed strong problem-solving skills and the ability to translate data into actionable insights.
I am eager to leverage my expertise to contribute to innovative projects and make a meaningful impact in a data-driven organization.
